# EuroBasketApp
## Description
#### 

The project is an application for managing a 3x3 European basketball championship. The purpose of the application is to facilitate access to the championship database through an easy-to-use graphical user interface. The application can also be used by the organizers, but also by those who follow the championship. This way all basketball fans will be able to track results or other information about teams or players.
